# MemoryGame

This is a project that I initially started as a school project with the goal of making a memory game in Python that would run on the terminal. When I finished I was left wanting a little bit more. Because of this I started learning a module named Pygame that would allow you to make games with Python and make them have their own window and have a somewhat UI. So I reacreted this project using Pygame.

## How it works
This game is really simple to play. There's two players and each player has a turn represented with the letters of player one or player two turning green. Each turn has to pick two cards from the board that have not been permanently open. If these two cards have the same number you get a point and the cards will remain permanently open.
To win you must remember which card contains which number and have the most points in the game!


Have Fun!
